""" API module for pySpaceGDN.

This is a really light wrapper around the API.
It only loads the json to python objects.

All public functions will return a list of results if the query was
successfull, or a dictionary with the error if it failed. The module is written
for both Python 2.7.x and Python 3.x, the only thing to keep in mind is that
the strings in the results will always be utf-8.

All functions may raise HTTPErrors.

Most functions should be self explainable, but this should probably be read
first: https://github.com/connor4312/SpaceGDN
Notably is searching which is done from the regular methods, for example:
    spacegdn.jars(where=something)
